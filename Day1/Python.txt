Python

1.Commenting:
In Python anything we write after a # is called comment.
This is usually used to tell info about your script or any info about a code of block.

2.Strings:
In python a group of text is called strings.
A string can be surrounded by '' single quotes or double quotes ""
example: "This is a string" 'This is a string'

3.Variables:
Programming languages offer a method of storing data for reuse. If there is a greeting we want to present, a date we need to reuse, or a user ID we need to remember we can create a
variable which can store a value. In Python, we assign variables by using the equals sign (=).

example:
# We've defined the variable "meal" here to the name of the food we ate for breakfast!
meal = "An english muffin"

# Printing out breakfast
print("Breakfast:")
print(meal)

# Now update meal to be lunch!
meal = "South Indian Meal"

# Printing out lunch
print("Lunch:")
print(meal)

# Now update "meal" to be dinner
meal = "Dosa"
# Printing out dinner
print("Dinner:")
print(meal)

4.Errors:
Two common errors that we encounter while writing Python are SyntaxError and NameError.

    SyntaxError means there is something wrong with the way your program is written â€” punctuation that does not belong, a command where it is not expected, or a missing parenthesis can all trigger a SyntaxError.

    A NameError occurs when the Python interpreter sees a word it does not recognize. Code that contains something that looks like a variable but was never defined will throw a NameError.
