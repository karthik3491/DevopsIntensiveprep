SHELL SCRIPTING
1. How to define a varibale?
VARIABLE="NAME"
if we want to access a variable from environment we can use export VARIABLE="NAME" but the problem is this will be erased once we restart the machine or logout
To persist the variable, we can save them in the ~/.bashrc file this file should be opened in root mode to make this changes
POSITIONAL PARAMETER
$0,$1,$2 these are called positional parameters
The script file itself will take the positional parameter $0
example ./script.sh $1 $2 
#!/bin/bash
REGION=$1

if [ $REGION == "us-east-1" ]
then
    echo "this is in US"
fi

Special Parameter
$? --> Provides exit status of last command
0 means that the last executed command was successful, other numbers denote the command was not successful
**ls /tmp**
**echo $?   # prints 0 if /tmp exists**
$# --> Prints the number of Parameters provided to the script
